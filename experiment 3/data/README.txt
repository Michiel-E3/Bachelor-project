All runs were performed immediately after the ethanol trail finished depositing via the motorized line, with the robot initialized at the same starting location.

Early runs until run 6 may have been run at 2 second movement intervals - check in data analysis. This movement interval can affect how long it took the robot to adapt, because it only senses the ethanol once per movement interval.
